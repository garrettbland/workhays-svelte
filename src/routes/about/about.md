## Job Seekers Tips

### Professional Email Address and Voicemail Message

When you begin your job search, make sure your email address and voicemail message are simple and professional. Avoid anything off-the-wall, inappropriate, or bizarre to ensure they won't harm your chances of being contacted by an employer. Paying attention to these small details can significantly improve your chances of being hired.

### Email Address

- Create a new email address specifically for your job search to avoid mixing personal and job-related emails.
- Include your name in the email address (e.g., `firstname.lastname@xyz.com`) so employers can easily find your correspondence.
- It‚Äôs acceptable to create an email address related to your profession, such as `SallySalesManager@xyz.com`.
- Avoid complicated addresses with long strings of numbers, as they can lead to errors when entered.

### Voicemail Message

- Include your name or phone number, mention that you‚Äôre unavailable, and ask callers to leave their name, number, and message.
  - Example: _"Hi, this is Rachel. I‚Äôm unable to take your call now, but please leave your name, number, and message after the tone, and I‚Äôll return your call as soon as possible. Thank you."_
- Speak clearly and professionally when recording your greeting.
